# Playing with Friends

One great feature of Minecraft is playing together with friends. Kids act out their imaginary stories or figure out how to cooperate on big building projects.

## LAN play

The simplest way to do multiplayer, but also requires everyone to be in the same place! 
As long as the players are running the same edition and are on the same local network e.g. all connected to your home WIFI, their devices can 'see' each other and join the same game.
This method does not require login accounts.

## Bedrock Edition - Microsoft Account

To do online multiplayer in Bedrock Edition the player will need a Microsoft account to log in with. For your kids, the best way to do this is using 'Microsoft Family'.
You will need different email addresses for the parent and for each child.

**1. Create a parent account.**
Go to <https://account.microsoft.com/> and log in with your existing account if you have one, or create a new account.
