## Minecraft Editions

A source of some confusion is that there are two major 'editions' of Minecraft. There are some minor differences in gameplay, but the biggest issue is that they cannot do multiplayer with each other. 

**Java Edition** is the original Minecraft, which runs on Windows, Mac and Linux computers.

**Minecraft**, commonly known as **Bedrock Edition**, runs on Windows 10, iOS, Android, XBox One, Nintendo Switch and Playstation 4.

There are also _Legacy_ editions on some older games consoles. Not recommended - they don't support multi-player and aren't getting updates.

_Note that_ Windows 10 can run either edition - which you choose may depend on what system friends are playing on.

`Techie stuff:` _there are unofficial ways to run Bedrock Edition on Mac or Linux. Write-up TODO_
